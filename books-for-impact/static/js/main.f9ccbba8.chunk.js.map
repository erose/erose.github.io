But it also means I'm not getting a bus fare, a light bulb, or anything else with that $2.50. And if I buy that strawberry milkshake, according to standard economics it means there's nothing else in the world I would rather buy with that money.</p>\n\n//     <p>I don't think we're usually that rational.</p>\n\n//     <p>For one thing, it's unpleasant to think about negatives. We like to think about what our money does get us, rather than the infinite variety of things it doesn't get. Also, there are so many alternatives that we can't really consider them all every time we spend money.</p>\n\n//     <p>I once saw a flippant proposal that we draw people's attention to this in a gruesome way by labeling all prices in Dead Child Currency. If it costs $800 to save a child's life, each $800 spent on anything else... you get the idea.</p>\n\n//     <p>I used to make myself think that way. Before I parted with any money, I'd ask myself what it could do for a woman in Africa. (It doesn't have to be her, but that's who I always imagined.) Did I value my new jeans more than her month's groceries? More than her children's vaccinations or school fees? Could I make that tradeoff?</p>\n\n//     <p>Sometimes I made it and felt awful afterwards. After spending $2 on a caramel apple in the fall of 2008, I had one such episode of weepy regret that was the last straw for Jeff. That's when we started having a spending allowance for us both which could not be given to charity. For several years now this is where our mandolin strings, birthday presents, clothes, vacations, and milkshakes have come from. It's also the source of non-optimal donations we make to public radio, etc. It's not a large budget by American standards, but it's made for a lot less angst.</p>\n\n//     <p>I recently met a young man who was seriously thinking these things over. “But isn't it right to think about the tradeoffs?” he asked. I think it's good to go through a period of thinking that way. Just like when you live in another country for a while you start being able to understand prices without converting back to your own currency, when you start thinking about all your spending in Vaccination Currency or Mosquito Net Currency it becomes habitual. Your spending habits can't help but be affected.</p>\n\n//     <p>I also think there's only so much grief we can carry. I cannot go the next 70 years counting dead children on every receipt. I would break.</p>\n\n//     <p>So my advice is to spend a while really noticing that tradeoff. Notice whether you really do value the milkshake more than a child's vaccination. And then, after a time, make yourself a budget that reflects those values. Set aside money for unnecessary things that make you happy. Do what you think will nurture you to age 100 as a generous and strategic giver.

The students each put their hand on the plate and found the side next to the radiator cool, and the distant side warm. And the instructor said, <i>Why do you think this happens?</i> Some students guessed convection of air currents, and others guessed strange metals in the plate. They devised many creative explanations, none stooping so low as to say “I don’t know” or “This seems impossible.”</p>\n\n    <p>And the answer was that before the students entered the room, the instructor turned the plate around.</p>\n\n    <p>Consider the student who frantically stammers, “Eh, maybe because of the heat conduction and so?” I ask: Is this answer a proper belief?

For us, the substance of a model is the control it exerts on anticipation. If you say “heat conduction,” what experience does that lead you to <i>anticipate</i>? Under normal circumstances, it leads you to anticipate that, if you put your hand on the side of the plate near the radiator, that side will feel warmer than the opposite side.

Further, the success of designs for social organization depends upon the recognition that local, practical knowledge is as important as formal, epistemic knowledge. The author builds a persuasive case against “development theory” and imperialistic state planning that disregards the values, desires, and objections of its subjects. He identifies and discusses four conditions common to all planning disasters: administrative ordering of nature and society by the state; a “high-modernist ideology” that places confidence in the ability of science to improve every aspect of human life; a willingness to use authoritarian state power to effect large- scale interventions; and a prostrate civil society that cannot effectively resist such plans.\",\n    \"<i>Description from <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp/0300078153' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Amazon</a>.</i>\",\n  ],\n\n  quotes: [\n    {\n      text: \"Illuminating and beautifully written, this book calls into sharp relief the nature of the world we now inhabit.\",\n      byline: \"<i>The New Yorker</i>\",\n    },\n    {\n      text: \"One of the most profound and illuminating studies of this century to have been published in recent decades.\",\n      byline: \"<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>\",\n    },\n    {\n      text: \"A powerful, and in many insightful, explanation as to why grandiose programs of social reform, not to mention revolution, so often end in tragedy...
