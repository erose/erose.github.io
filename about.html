<p>Hi, I'm Eli Rose. I studied computer science and creative writing at <a href="http://www.oberlin.edu">Oberlin College</a> and now live in Cambridge, MA. I am Director of Engineering at <a href="https://www.mentorcollective.org/">Mentor Collective</a>.</p>
<p>This blog is for writing stuff down that would otherwise fly through and out of my life. Also, so other people can see it.</p>

<p>I want to follow some rules strictly. Here I'm publicly listing the rules I want to hold myself to. See my post on <a href="/posts/rules_within_consequentialism">rules within consequentialism</a> for more detail.</p>
<p><b>Vegetarianism</b>: I will not put animal flesh into my mouth, with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>flesh from animals of the class <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivalvia">Bivalvia</a></li>
</ul>
<p>"Animal flesh" is left without definition; if the common-sense definition is called into question, I will update this text. This means that this commitment may allow me to eat something which I later will refine it to disallow me from eating; I am okay with that.</p>

  Description
</div>

<p><em>(Starting at the most salient and proceeding to the speculative.)</em></p>
<p>I am habitually analytical. It is natural for me to ask "why?". I am strongly driven to understand things in their essence, in simplest terms, and am often unsatisfied with explanations I feel are too complex or too surface-level. In other words I am driven to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">refactor</a> my understanding, often in conversation with other people. My analytic nature leads to my enthusiasm for math, computer programming, literary + music criticism, science, and introspection.</p>
<p>I feel emotions very strongly. I cry or come close to crying pretty often, during difficult conversations or in response to art. Abstract considerations can cause strong emotion for me — for example, suffering in the world (negative) or an idea about our how we are all connected (positive).</p>
<p>Sometimes I will be unable to function normally because I feel so bad, even though there is no immediate cause. Other times I will spontaneously feel like everything is great. Both states last a handful of hours and end when I go to sleep.</p>
<p>I find I tend to speak too quickly, to say 'uh' a lot, or to mumble.</p>
<p>Other people's mental states have a big impact on me — for example, if two people are having an argument on the street, I will be disturbed for a while after I've passed by them. Same goes for social dynamics, even in conversations I'm not a part of. For example, I remember a conversation strangers had near me in a coffee shop in 2016, just because one of the participants said something embarrassing. If I feel that the social dynamics of a conversation are bad, it will distract me and I'll be less able to participate.</p>
