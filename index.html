<blockquote>
<p>A king has 100 bottles of wine, exactly one of which is poisoned. He decides to figure out which it is by feeding the wines to some of his servants, and seeing which ones drop dead. He wants to find out before the poisoner has a chance to get away, and so he doesn't have enough time to do this sequentially - instead he plans to give each servant some combination of the wines tonight, and see which are still alive tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>a) How many servants does he need?</p>
<p>b) Suppose he had 100 servants - then how many wines could he test?</p>

        <p>When I was a kid, I remember hearing about the various damages of the world. War, corruption, the mismanagement of countries, families starving below the poverty line. Like a lot of kids, I was disturbed at this news and concocted various kid schemes to make everything better. I designed a utopia in fifth grade where everything was solar-powered, so the environment wouldn't get damaged. (I really wanted blaster guns, so I also made solar-powered blaster guns. But I remembered that it was supposed to be a utopia without war. I compromised by deciding the blasters were used only for mining.)</p>
<p>Later I still felt uneasy. I was overwhelmed by the scale of the wrongness, like one is overwhelmed by the number of stars in the universe. It was a relief to mentally assign responsibility for these problems to people of similar scale — presidents, secretary-generals, diplomats. I imagined people infinitely wiser than myself in these positions. (In fairness, that was correct, because I was twelve.) They were the competent authorities.</p>

However, it seemed to me and my friend that we could strictly improve the movie with some small tweaks.

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I know the Coriolis Effect from 9th-grade earth science as what causes hurricanes to spin; counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The idea is this: imagine teleporting a section of air from the Equator to the North Pole. An exceptionally violent wind would result, because the rotation of the earth means that air around the equator is moving at ~ 1000 miles/hour, while air around the North Pole is hardly moving at all.</p>
<p>Generalize. So as air moves north in the Northern Hemisphere, it will find itself to be moving eastward (the Earth rotates from west to east) faster than the other air surrounding it. Hence it will end up moving in a northeasterly direction (relative to that other air), rather than just north. For the same reasons, air that is moving south in the Northern Hemisphere will find itself being pushed to the west. Things are reversed in the Southern Hemisphere. The overall effect is to add a lateral component to north/south motion on any rotating sphere.</p>

<p>Today I'll be analysing the song <em>Autoclave</em>, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mountain_Goats">The Mountain Goats</a>, off their 2008 album <em>Heretic Pride</em>. You can see the lyrics I'll be referencing and listen to the song on <a href="https://genius.com/The-mountain-goats-autoclave-lyrics">Genius</a>. Additionally, here's a video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ-2kbculaI">John Darnielle performing the song live in front of a huge troll statue</a> which I thoroughly recommend.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>One way to convey digital information across distances is through copper wire (Ethernet cable). Here we just vary the voltage in the wire between two states A and B. When we are at A, we are sending a <code>0</code>, and when we are at B we are sending a <code>1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is voltage? Voltage is the delta between two points of an electrical field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These states are called <code>symbols</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of symbols / seconds is a unit called <code>baud</code>. If your symbol rate is 1 symbol per second, you are sending information at 1 baud.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the most impressive discoveries was the origin of the energy of the stars, that makes them continue to burn. One of the men who discovered this was out with his girlfriend the night after he realized that nuclear reactions must be going on in the stars in order to make them shine. She said “Look at how pretty the stars shine!” He said “Yes, and right now I am the only man in the world who knows why they shine.” She merely laughed at him. She was not impressed with being out with the only man who, at that moment, knew why stars shine. Well, it is sad to be alone, but that is the way it is in this world.</p>
