<li>The <img src="images/PenSelected.png" width="20%"> tab contains blocks that change pen properties.  You could change it (make it thicker, change its color or shading, etc.) depending on things (whether Alonzo is clicked, moves by itself, the high score is surpassed, etc.).</li>
<li>The <img src="images/LookSelected.png" width="20%"> tab contains blocks that control visual properties of Alonzo's sprite.  You could change it (make it fade out, change its size, say something) depending on things (whether Alonzo is clicked, moves by itself, the high score is surpassed, etc.).</li>
<li>more?</li>
</ul>
