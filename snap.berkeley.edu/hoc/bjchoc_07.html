<h3>Step 8: Remember and display the Maximum score</h3>
<p>
Using the same ideas you did for the last step of doing things
conditionally, what we'd like to do here is solve the problem that you
have a score that rises and falls and you'd like to keep track of "the
high water mark".  Make a new variable <tt>MAX SCORE</tt> that's shown
on the stage (you can move it around so it doesn't
obscure <TT>SCORE</TT>), and have it always contain the highest score
every achieved in one game.
