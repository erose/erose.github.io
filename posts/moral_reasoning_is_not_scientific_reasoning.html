    <div class="post-title">Moral Reasoning Is Not Scientific Reasoning</div>
    <div class="post-date">Thursday, August 30th, 2018</div>

<div>
    <p>I am in the process of shifting my model of what <em>moral reasoning</em> is, and by extension what <em>moral debate</em> is. I think that although both models work equally well to describe many facets of moral reasoning, my new model offers a better explanation for several particular facets. By "moral reasoning" I mean for example what we do when we are deciding whether or not to pull the lever in the trolley problem.</p>
<p>I will describe the old model I am moving away from first. Let's call it "Moral Reasoning As Scientific Reasoning."</p>
<h3>Old Model</h3>
<p>When we consider an act morally, we search our minds for theories that might be able to apply to the act to get an output of "moral" or "immoral". For example, "honesty is the best policy" is one such theory that applies to certain acts. It has limited scope; it has nothing to say about murder. An example of a theory with wider scope would be "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." An example of a theory with even wider scope is any of those flavors of utilitarianism which holds that creating a new morally relevant being is good if its experiences are net positive.</p>
