    <div class="post-title">How Easy Is It To Do A Lot Of Good?</div>
    <div class="post-date">Tuesday, August 16th, 2016</div>

<div class="post-content">
    <p>How easy is it to do a lot of good? Imagine that opportunities to improve the world were tangible and visible. Say they look like purple jelly beans. When you pick one up, bam! Someone's life is a little better.</p>
<p>In world <strong>A</strong>, jelly beans are plentiful. Maybe they rain down from the sky every week. Everywhere in the country, this is true. The sidewalks are covered in jelly beans. Everyone picks up a few just going to work every day.</p>
<p>In world <strong>B</strong>, jelly beans are only found underground. And they're scarce, and unpredictable. Miners have to take a pickaxe and shovel, climb down a shaft, and do a lot of manual digging. Every few months, someone has a bright idea for how to predict jelly bean strains better and mine them faster; results are contentious and inconclusive. The way most jelly beans are found is by someone individually picking them out of the rock.</p>
<p>World <strong>A</strong> is obviously better off. But let's say that both worlds have serious problems, and something (i.e. jelly beans) needs to be done about them.</p>
<p>In world <strong>A</strong>, personal power is important. For example, being in charge of stuff. If you're in charge of a fishing fleet, you can use it to go pick up all those neglected beans floating in the Atlantic. You'll improve the world massively. If you're in charge of a college or university, you can outfit its roofs with a aqueduct system to capture any jelly beans that, previously, laid there until they dissolved.</p>
<p>In world <strong>B</strong>, it's less important. If you're a college or university president, you can try to instill good bean-spotting instincts in your undergraduates so that someday their yields will be higher. But being a good bean-spotter is really hard, so being marginally better at it doesn't help that much. If you're a researcher working on bean-harvesting techniques, you won't expect easy, runaway success.</p>
<p>Do we live in world <strong>A</strong> or world <strong>B</strong>?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism">Effective Altruism</a> would say <strong>A</strong>, I think. Certainly, statistics about how you can save a life for <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-worlds-best-charity-can-save-a-life-for-333706-and-thats-a-steal-2015-7">$3,337.06</a> get you thinking that way.</li>
<li>A focus on improving skills and prestige to get personal power (<a href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a>) follows if you're thinking in world <strong>A</strong>.</li>
<li>I think my culture (me included) tends to feel intuitively that unsexy, unprestigious work is especially noble or valuable. e.g. being a teacher, or a policeman, or a fireman. This seems like it's coming from world <strong>B</strong> -- if good is difficult to do, better do something dependable and well-trodden.</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer to the question is definitely 'both', and of course depends on what issues you're talking about. But I think it's still controversial just how much the world is like each.</p>
<p>There's a lot of variations/counterarguments I'll put in another post.</p>
