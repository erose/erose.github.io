<p><strong>Spoiler Warning</strong> -- watch the movie first.</p>
<hr>

<p>What is the deal with <em>Annihilation</em>'s ending? I think it may have deep substance, but I worry it's just a collection of heady-sci-fi tropes that <strong>feel</strong> deep.</p>
<p>That question about the ending is my motivation for writing this post, but of course we'll need to pull in earlier stuff from the movie as well -- stuff which I think is more obviously good than the ending. If you cut it off right before Lena hears Ventriss's voice in the lighthouse, <em>Annihilation</em> would be totally functional. Specifically, it would be a character-driven horror movie with heady sci-fi themes. It's already doing what it needs to do: the altered landscape is creepy and awe-inducing -- touches like the throwaway shot of the eel-fish (<strong>?</strong>) give a sense that the alterations are more numerous and strange than we the viewers could ever personally see. The volunteers are remarkably well-drawn and differentiated for how little screen time they individually get. Their fates are relevant and true to their individual stories, not just Lena's story. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anya the paramedic -- she has a lot to cope with and her coping strategy is refusing to face the problem, denial, distraction. She jokes about hooking up with Lena to distract herself from the suicide mission, she insists the tentacles in the videotape are "a trick of the light". Though a thousand kinds of horrifying, the scene where she ties everyone up to a chair is cathartic, because she is standing up for herself. Indeed she fights up to the end, although it ends up being the bear-pig and not her teammates. <sup><a href='#1'>1</a></sup></li>
<li>Josie the physicist -- her drive is to understand things bigger than herself, and as we know from her past, she has difficulty being happy with life as it is presented to her. But her fate is not a recapitulation of her past; her self-harm was an attempt to "feel more alive" (as Cass tells it) through her body, while now she decides to abandon that body. <sup><a href='#2'>2</a></sup></li>
<li>Cass the geologist -- okay, not much here. Her sudden offscreen death is not connected to her backstory of losing a child to leukemia. The one additional comment she provides -- "it's like losing two people, my son and the person I was then" -- is interesting and thematic as a statement, but it's hard to connect it to anything Cass does later on. Cass kind of seems like the Too Good To Die person here.</li>
<li>Ventriss the psychologist -- my favorite; more on this later.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we ended the movie early, we would even have a pretty satisfying answer to the question of "what's happening?", both at a literal and a thematic level -- I think. Let's try it out.</p>
<hr>

<p>Josie's explanation is correct, the entity both causes cells to divide rapidly and "refracts" the second copy of the cell, altering it as Lena sees when she views her blood beneath a microscope. This is why one plant can show many different species' flowers on its branches. The cells get refracted when they divide, and their genes turn into something similar but different. This is what's happening on a literal level.</p>
<p>Thematically, the entity is not only accelerating change but causing an organism to explore all possible changes at once. It makes visible all possible variety, a multitude of options. For example, the plant with many species, the man tied to the chair who exploded into a multifarious fungus, the bear-pig taking on aspects of Cass, the forest bursting with different colors. It makes different parts of a whole go in different directions, directions that lead away from each other.</p>
<p>This is dangerous to an organism for the same reason that cancer is. (Lena studies cancer; Ventriss apparently has cancer.) It's unsustainable in the long run; the volunteers' bodies will not hold together. Metaphorically, this oversupply of diverging options is what Keane says is "hard to bear" in his videotape. Literally he is probably talking about having to cut his friend open and seeing him transform into a fungus.</p>
<p>The idea of "too many options" also applies to Lena's life; there are too many.</p>
<hr>

<p>Okay, that was</p>
<div>
  <sub id='1'>[1] Presumably, Anya went through a period of denial where her drinking was a problem but she didn't acknowledge it, before the moment arrived when she couldn't deny it anymore. Her seeing her skin move on its own -- <i>it's inside you</i> -- perhaps is that moment now. Further questions: how did Anya get sober? Did she do it herself, or did friends and family push her?</sub>
</div>

<div>
  <sub id='2'>[2] Her death is more peaceful than Cass's or Anya's, which the movie contrasts it against -- but it is not elevated above theirs. She does not return in spirit form to help Lena later. Her death is a pretty popular choice, as evidenced by the grove of other human tree forms around the base.</sub>
