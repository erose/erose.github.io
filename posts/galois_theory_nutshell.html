    <div class="post-title">Very Quick Sketch of Galois Theory</div>
    <div class="post-date">Saturday, September 30th, 2017</div>
</div>
<div>
    <p>(I'm just writing this to help myself remember. YMMV.)</p>
<p><em>Question</em>: we can write down a general formula for the roots of a quadratic, cubic, or quartic polynomial in terms of the coefficients. Why can't we do it for a quintic polynomial?</p>
<p><em>Explanation</em>: Extend $\mathbb{Q}$ by taking roots and you will introduce certain symmetries (automorphisms which leave $\mathbb{Q}$ fixed). All the automorphisms introduced this way are cyclic in structure.</p>
<p>The groups $S_2, S_3, S_4$ all have the property of decomposing in a certain nice way: they have a chain of normal subgroups which leave behind a cyclic group when quotiented out. But $S_{\geq 5}$ does not have this property (not "solvable")<sup>*</sup>.</p>
<p>The theorem: a polynomial $p$ is solvable by radicals $\Leftrightarrow$ $\text{Gal}(p)$ is solvable.<sup></sup> It's true because of the isomorphism between field extensions and Galois subgroups. If we wanted to build a tower of field extensions (by taking roots) which culminated in a field that could hold the roots of the quintic, we would have to be able to add cyclic groups the whole way. But we can't reach $S_{\geq 5}$ this way, because no chain.</p>
<div class='normal-line-height'>
  <div class='small'>
    * The obstruction is that $A_5$, the only candidate to start the chain off with, doesn't have any normal subgroups ("simple").

<p><strong>Extra:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This lovely <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~osserman/classes/250B-W11/lattice.pdf">diagram</a> of the isomorphism for $p = x^4 - 2$.</li>
<li>Implication which I somehow never realized until right now: there exist algebraic numbers, i.e. the roots of some $p \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$, which we have no "formula for". That is, no agreed-upon way to write them other than just exhibiting $p$. (You might object that this is a matter of convention and no different than the situation with $\sqrt{2}$, and you might have a point.) At any rate, these are called <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/657168/understanding-non-solvable-algebraic-numbers">non-solvable numbers</a>.</li>
