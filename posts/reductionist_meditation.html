    <p>I am interested in a wasp. For example, what is a wasp?
To start with, it's any member of one of several groups.
OK, what is a black and yellow mud dauber wasp?
It's a scratch of color flying through my view from the porch, it's an impression
made by vibrating wings in my ear, it's the snarling alarm
of the welt on the back of my hand.
OK, but what is out there <em>(gestures)</em> that is a wasp?
There's some entity, some force of being,
behind those things. A counterpart: another voter in the town meeting.
What is out there that is that entity?
Some collection of cells, which in my mind always resemble Fisher Price toys:
dyed the plastic blues and reds of the 7th-grade textbook artist's conception. 
The cells swim in cytoplasm; they cohere in a certain shape
and perform their strange circus of function.
That is the account of the wasp's entity,
and consequently mine. But I think of the brightly colored
wasp cell, floating in the petri dish, breathing.
What is out there that is the cell?
There's a parade of smaller objects: molecules, atoms, electrons, quarks,
with which to answer this question. The understanding
runs out, like water from a hole in a bucket.
In the end, something small and diamondlike remains on the bucket's floor.
What is it?
Something is out there, and it stings my hand red.</p>
