<p>This Cambridge, MA Jeep's window presents a difficult case in bumper sticker analysis. What is the person like who would assemble such a collection?</p>
<p>We can see the author wishes to make clear their preferences for beer ("beer" and "Coors Light") and for boobies ("Boobies Make Me Smile"), top left. Crass, but straightforward.</p>
<p>Yet there is also "Chobani ❤️ Scientists" southeast of center. Chobani, as a signifier, stands in stark contrast to beer and boobies. And what are we to make of "❤️ Scientists"? Googling "chobani heart scientists" reveals a 2014 controversy in which Chobani, as part of their healthy-natural-foods marketing, put the phrase "Nature got us to 100 calories, not scientists" on their yogurt lids. Backlash ensued, and Chobani apologized.</p>
<p>The bumper sticker appears designed to reassure the world that Chobani actually does ❤️ scientists, in spite of this. But why would private individual buy and display a bumper sticker whose message is basically one of damage control? Who would be invested enough in the dispute between Chobani and scientists that friendly relations between those groups would be a central part of their identity? We may imagine a Greek yogurt-lover who is also a scientist, in addition to being a boobies-lover and Coors Light fan.</p>
<p>There is also the mystery of "Lifted, So My Dick Doesn't Drag" on the top right. At first blush, "Lifted" seems to refer to a higher state of being -- perhaps an in-phrase signifying both spiritual uplift and participation in a movement, just as the followers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_B">Lil B</a> call themselves "based". For a spiritual message, it is jarringly crass. Particularly the insinuation that the un-"lifted" people are some type of monstrous ape who walk around with their dicks dragging on the ground. I am intrigued.</p>
<p>On second sad thought, maybe "lifted" just refers to the fact that the Jeep's wheels are higher than those of other cars.
The Jeep's dick would then be its tailpipe.</p>
<p>I don't know what the flag is.</p>
