    <div class="post-title">Buzzfeed Messed Up Some Statistics And What That Means About The World</div>
    <div class="post-date">Tuesday, January 8th, 2019</div>
</div>
<div>
    <p><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work">This article</a>, about millenials and burnout, contains the following assertion (at the time of writing this post):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The planet is dying. Democracy is under serious threat. American adults report being <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/newsroom/apa-public-opinion-poll-annual-meeting-2018">39% more anxious</a> than a year ago...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The link goes to poll in which the American Psychiatric Association talked to 1,000 American adults. Below are reproduced the results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><h3>In general, are you more or less anxious than you were at this time last year?</h3>
<ul>
  <li><span>More anxious</span> <b>39%</b></li>
  <li><span>Less anxious</span> <b>19%</b></li>
  <li><span>About the same</span> <b>39%</b></li>
  <li><span>Not sure</span> <b>3%</b></li>
</ul></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The error is that Buzzfeed has confused "39% of adults say they are more anxious" with "adults are 39% more anxious." For example, 100% of Americans are older than they were last year, but Americans are not 100% older than they were last year. <em>Come on, guys</em>.</p>
<p>A 39% increase in anything on a survey like this should be large enough, I think, to merit a double take. That's how my friend and I found this error -- we looked at it, and said "Really?". I guess I see how this wording or even the whole distinction between "39% had some increase" and "39% increase" could slip if you're the author with your mind on a billion things. But how many people at Buzzfeed read this article before it went to print? How many of them looked at this number and did not do a double take? How could they have missed it?</p>
<p>I think the answer is that the number conveys a <em>point</em>, </p>
