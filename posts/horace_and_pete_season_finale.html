    <p>Warning: <strong>SPOILERS FOR HORACE AND PETE, INCLUDING THE SEASON FINALE</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://louisck.net/show/horace-and-pete">This show is one of life's pleasures</a>. I would hate it if I diminished your enjoyment of this show by spoiling some stuff for you. Hence this filler paragraph to prevent any of this post from showing up on the main page. Click (<em>more</em>) if you want more.</p>
<hr>

<p>The season finale of Horace and Pete is 95% a perfectly reasonable episode. I think that's actually an understatement: the episode is 54 minutes long, and the twist ending can't take more than a minute to play out from when Pete shows up in the doorway. Debatably, the coda with Sylvia and Horace's son could have run without it.</p>
<p>So, what do we have? In the last minute of a ten-episode-long series, the main character is killed as nightmarishly as possible. It's a soap opera event; so much of its wallop remains even if you only consider the bare facts of what happened. Like if your friend narrated it to you over the phone as they watched. You'd still be shocked.</p>
<p>I don't intend "soap opera" as a value judgement here. Horace &amp; Pete uses soap opera all the time, and it's great. Soap opera, by which I suppose I mean the very unlikely and the ridiculously tragic, is such a big part of the Horace &amp; Pete feel. Laurie Metcalf confessing to sleeping with her husband's father. Sylvia announcing that she has cancer.</p>
<p>When Horace and Pete was working, it was taking in dozens of these unlikely, abstract problems and "ramming them with the sun" to become characters that we loved and wished would never die.</p>
