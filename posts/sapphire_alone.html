<h3>Sapphire Alone</h3>
<div class='stanza'>
  <p>still knows fire. It's the stilling flame,</p>
  <p>the burning touch, of ice. Inside her eye, events are justified and debated</p>
  <p>as in a great and rowdy parliament, full of red-faced men, bitterly opposed,</p>
  <p>advances met with counteradvances, so each thought is pushed back and forth forever.</p>
  <p>Resonant, like a guitar string, all forward progress trapped in vibration.</p>
  <p>In the hall of her mind, their voices rise, day and dusk, in fear.</p>
  <p>Fear is inspired by every action. Even inaction.</p>
  <p>"Ruin, ruin! A slippery slope!" they shout.</p>
  <p>"Thoughtless! Callous! What my opponent has failed to consider..."</p>
</div>

<!-- Manually include the first stanza in the preview that renders on the main page. -->

<!-- ENDPREVIEW -->

<div class='stanza'>
  <p>On a good day, the parliamentarians can compromise on</p>
  <p>not direct movement, but something sort of sideways,</p>
  <p>poised and perfect, demurely beautiful, words</p>
  <p>sagely to the tenth decimal place. Revealing only</p>
  <p>the future that is near. To venture farther is fiercely debated,</p>
  <p>both too hot and too cold, uncertain, without direction.</p>
  <p>So she pretends not to know, and curls her hands: "My Diamond."</p>
</div>

<div class='stanza'>
  <p>On a bad day, she winces staring at the motel ceiling,</p>
  <p>watching with dull fear the arc of every line that leads forward from her mind,</p>
  <p>and her bed turns to ice, and the carpet turns to ice</p>
  <p>and ice stills the tongue of the fountain, trapping its water molecules</p>
  <p>to shiver in vibration, just as Sapphire shivers in cogitation,</p>
  <p>wrapped in her uninsulating blanket.</p>
</div>

<div class='stanza'>
  <p>For a time, Sapphire longed for the others' minds:</p>
  <p>a warm conviction to rally the parliament, or perhaps, she thought later, just a drive</p>
  <p>other than the drive to be correct.</p>
  <p>But, she saw even later, after she was bathed in love:</p>
  <p>the others did not agree, suffered and argued</p>
  <p>about what to do. This was also a parliament.</p>
  <p>Enacted in slow motion, and where mistakes counted.</p>
</div>

<div class='stanza'>
  <p>Sapphire, let your fire burn</p>
  <p>blue for us, as bright as you are able, tracing a line far into uncertainty.</p>
  <p>We will contend with you in your mind. We will add our voices to the blaze.</p>
  <p>Perhaps that will help. When you are tired of debating yourself,</p>
  <p>and the ocean freezes beneath you,</p>
  <p>sleep on its surface, and we will carry on above.</p>
  <p>We believe there is a trend to the argument, like the gentle curve of the horizon,</p>
  <p>though Sapphire alone has swum out far enough to see it.</p>
