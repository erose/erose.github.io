    <p>Into a Dragon Ball Z or Marvel Universe world, run by superbeings with various thematic powers, who battle each other by shouting out the names of their moves, is inserted Saitama, the bald, everyman protagonist.</p>
<p>He's an amateur superhero. His power is to simply kill anyone in a single punch, which he uses on the monsters that are endlessly tearing down buildings and devouring apartment dwellers in his hometown, City <em>Z</em>. (There is also City <em>A</em>, City <em>B</em>, etc. which appear to comprise the rest of the world). A running gag is to introduce a huge, stunningly-drawn monster, linger over the destruction in their wake, continue as they explain their origins and plans for our subjugation, and then have Saitama cut them off mid-sentence with a punch.</p>
<p><img class="centered" width="500px" height="auto" src="http://localhost:8000/static/images/one_punch_man_punch.jpg"></p>
<p>The joke is always the same, but I always laughed. The monsters are so beautifully grotesque and elaborate and their plans so earnest.</p>
<p>Sometimes monsters will survive long enough to start arcs, which keeps you on your toes.</p>
<p>The world of One Punch Man runs on individuals' "power", which is explicitly quantifiable even though it takes various forms: telekinesis, having a magic sword, lightning feet, shooting fireballs, having ghoulishly large muscles, ability to survive being punched into a mountain. Superheroes are regulated by the Heroes Association, which ranks them from A1 to C390, plus the super-elite S-class above them all.</p>
