<blockquote>
<p>A fireball spell is an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(In DnD, the notation <strong>x</strong>d<strong>y</strong> means "roll <strong>x</strong> die with <strong>y</strong> sides each, then take their sum").</p>
<p>So the average damage goes up as your level increases: at level one it's $3.5$, at level two it's $7$, at level three it's $10.5$. But not only does it go up -- it gets less variable. Below on the left is 1,000 fireballs cast by a first-level wizard; on the right is 1,000 fireballs cast by a third-level wizard.</p>
<div class='side-by-side'>

</div>

<p>The third-level wizard is much more likely to deal a boring amount of damage like $10$ or $11$ than the first-level wizard, who is just as likely to hit jackpot $(6)$ or fail miserably $(1)$ as they are to hit $3$.</p>
<p>Why? Well, there are lots of ways to get 3d6 to sum to $10$ (e.g you could have $\,(3 + 2 + 5)$, or $(1 + 6 + 3)$, or $(4 + 4 + 2)$) but only one way to get to $18$ (you have to roll $6 + 6 + 6$, nothing else will do). Since probability is $\frac{\text{distinguished outcomes}}{\text{all possible outcomes}}$, a result in the middle is more probable.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is the explanation we give when asked why so many things are normally distributed; when you average a bunch of independent random variables with the same mean $\mu$, their fluctuations are likely to cancel each other out, so the result ends up close to $\mu$.</p>
<p>One suspects that the surface differences here (we're adding the d6 rolls up, not averaging them) are not important, and indeed they aren't. The right-hand graph above already looks bell-curve-y, but we can smooth out the irregularities by repeating the experiment one million times instead of one thousand.</p>

</div>

<p>If switch to 100-sided die (we can stop pretending we're talking about Dungeons &amp; Dragons), the extra granularity lets us see the normal curve in all its beauty. This is 3d100 at 1000, 10,000, 100,000, and finally 1,000,000 trials.</p>

<hr />
<p>Higher (4th, 5th, ...)-level wizards also have what looks like normally distributed fireball damage. But 2nd-level wizards do <strong>not</strong>. Look! (Again with $10^3$, $10^4$, $10^5$, and $10^6$ trials).</p>

<p>This pyramid-shaped distribution is different from the normal in that it falls off linearly, not exponentially.</p>
