    <div class="post-title">What is the probability a random answer to this question will be correct?</div>

<div class="post-content">
    <p>Maybe you've seen this problem or its variations before:</p>
<div>
  <img src="/static/images/random_multiple_choice_question.png"></img>
</div>

<p>By considering each possibility in turn, we can show that there is no answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose that <strong>A</strong> were correct. It agrees with <strong>D</strong>. The probability of selecting either <strong>A</strong> or <strong>D</strong> by random chance is 50%, since there are four answers. So if <strong>A</strong> were correct, the probability of answering correctly by choosing at random would be 50% -- but then <strong>A</strong> would not be correct. Hence <strong>A</strong> is not the answer.</li>
<li>Suppose that <strong>B</strong> were correct. No other answer agrees with it, so the probability of being correct by chance would be the probability of selecting <strong>B</strong> by chance; that is, 25%. But then <strong>B</strong> would not be correct. Hence <strong>B</strong> is not the answer.</li>
<li><strong>C)</strong> cannot be correct by the same argument that applies to <strong>B</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>D</strong> cannot be correct by the same argument that applies to <strong>A</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may notice that there are fairly heavy restrictions on which problems of this kind have answers. It seems like we should be able to classify them all.</p>
<p>One observation: in order to be correct an answer must, at the very least, give a probability of the form $(\frac{k}{n})$% where <em>n</em> is the number of other answers -- if we have four answers and one of them is 37%, we can throw it right out since there is just no way to achieve that probability.</p>
<p>Another observation: if an answer $\frac{k}{n}$ is not repeated enough to constitute exactly $\frac{k}{n}$ of the <em>n</em> answers, it cannot be correct. (This was what we used to analyze the original problem.)</p>
<ul>
<li>67%</li>
<li>67%</li>
<li>33%</li>
</ul>
<p>2/3 of the time, we choose 67%. Is it correct?
1/3 of the time, we choose 33%. Is it correct?</p>
