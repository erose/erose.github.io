    <p><em>Background: At the time of writing, I had 3.5 years of experience working in the software industry, mostly as a web developer.</em></p>
<p>Modern software engineering work involves lots and lots of black boxes. We build our systems on top of them. We don't understand their inner workings -- merely the inputs and outputs they provide to us. The black boxes' sheer number and the total weight of complexity they handle make this lack of understanding inevitable for the vast majority of software projects. As much as we'd like to, we can't pause to read the whole Linux kernel before deploying our website to a Linux server. (And if we had to, deploying websites would be impossible.)</p>
<p>This is kind of an odd situation for a human enterprise. At least, I think it is odd. When a civil engineer designs a bridge, they also have to treat certain things as black boxes -- for instance, the chemical laws that govern the properties of concrete. (I'm guessing -- I have never built a bridge.) Yet the boundary seems of a different epistemic type. Notably, the inner workings of the "chemistry" black box weren't designed by humans, just discovered by them. There is no hope of tweaking how they work, or reading their source code. The inside of the "chemistry" black box is made of different stuff than the outside.</p>
<p>But software engineers know that the Ruby code they write is just instructions to be handed off to another piece of code, written by another software engineer like them, and so on for a couple layers like this before hitting the "physics" black box. Only in software engineering are there black boxes designed by humans. (???)</p>
